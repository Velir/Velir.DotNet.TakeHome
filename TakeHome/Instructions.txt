Instructions:

The customer needs a form page added to the website to collect user feedback. This form needs to include the user's name, their email address, and a text area for their feedback.

Your front-end developer has provided the form markup in an html file.  You need to incorporate this into the existing website.

Requirements:

- Create a new Feedback page and add it to the site header. The Feedback page should leverage the site layout. The body content area will contain the form markup provided by the front end team (see form.html).
- Create a model for the form and a controller to process the form post. 
- The form inputs must be validated. 
  - All fields are required. 
	- The character limit for all fields is 25, and 200 for the feedback field.
	- The email field should be a valid email address.
- Upon successful submission of the form the user should see a thank you page with the form data reflected (see thankyou.html). 
- If the user submits an invalid form, a validation error message should be displayed on the form page.
